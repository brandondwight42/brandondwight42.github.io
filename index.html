    <h2>What Others Have to Say About Brandon</h2>
    <p>There was never a baughring moment with Brandon!  -- Kyle Baugh</p>
    <p>Debugging Brandon's code was more exhilerating than solving the Da Vinci Code!  -- Joely Vernier</p>
    <p>Brandon was the most mild mannered and polite individual whom I have had the pleasure to do business with.  He definetly was my best runner!  When the cop's came to arrest him at my crack house, the cop's couldn't go through with it because he was just too gosh darn didly nice.  As the cops were handcuffing them he told them, "I'd offer you all some milk and doughnuts right now for your trouble if only I had a free hand!"  My father lamented that, "We might never find a gentleman and a dealer like him ever again!"  -- Scott Sutherland</p>
    <p>Brandon sold out so many of my bootcamps at AgentMountain that I was able to retire before I reached the legal age to drink in the US.  Hence that is why I've relocate to Germany.  --Andrew Elliot</p>
    <p>Is Brandon for real or is he just so gosh freakin' amazing at coding that he's AI?!  Since we never see him in person we might never know.  --Sei Gahn</p>
